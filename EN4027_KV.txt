Lotus of Ambrosia: A Prayer in Verse to Lokeśvara, the Moon of Compassion Namo Lokanāthāya! With the ambrosial light of virtue and goodness You cause the ocean of benefit and bliss to swell. Supreme noble one, Moon of Compassion, Bestow eternal auspiciousness! O Avalokiteśvara, by simply beholding The precious gem of your name, The poverty of existence and peace is vanquished- May you gladly nurture me until awakening! Supreme liberation, discerning mind, Long life, and abundant wealth- To the delight of all fortunate beings, you fulfill all such wishes. O Padmapāṇi, Lotus Holder, hold me in your care! "All those circling through the lower realms and saṃsāra, no matter who you are, I will establish in the higher realms and the freedom of nirvāṇa!" Thus, you declare. Friend whose intent is infused with compassion at all times, May I attain the state of Lord Avalokiteśvara! Through the power of that accomplishment, toward ourselves and all beings, Infinite in number as drops in an ocean, O noble one, may you extend your compassionate hand And lead me to the pure realm of Great Bliss! There, may Amitābha And the supreme noble one teach me eagerly, Such that with each passing moment I attain Dhāraṇīs and samādhis surpassing thought! May I not remain here in saṃsāra, Nor seek nirvāṇa, the far shore, But, through the Middle Way, may I swiftly attain The state of the Protector of the World! This Prayer in Verse to Noble Lokeśvara, the Moon of Compassion was composed in supplication by the maṇi reciter Mañjughoṣa. It was written in the moment while recalling the Lord of Potala. Siddhirastu.
